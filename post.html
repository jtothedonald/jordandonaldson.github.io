            <p>In our world of constantly advancing technology, it seems as though a new industry is born more often than in recent generations. For example, just ten years ago it would have been fairly impossible to predict the boom of the FinTech industry, especially as we know it today. With new technology, however, will come new regulations. What these new and disruptive companies do (or don’t do) today will certainly have an impact on their future success.</p>

            <p>For example, the electric scooter is becoming a large trend, especially in large metropolitan areas. This innovative form of ride sharing is taking the transportation industry by storm with its accessibility and affordable charm. Companies such as Lime, Bird, and Scoot are the largest players as of right now. One thing that I imagine they did not foresee, or maybe they did and brushed it off their shoulder, is the safety regulations. The first company to successfully lobby the local, state, and federal government in their favor will definitely win in the end.</p>

            <p>Now, there are several other industries that have, and will surely, run into regulatory battles. Drones/Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), Cryptocurrency, Blockchain, and especially Artificial Intelligence are just a select few areas of emerging technology under the government’s close watch. As soon as one of these companies slips up or intentionally breaks a law, “The Man” will swiftly move in and begin the stretching out of red tape.</p>

            <p>My best word of advice to these companies in disruptive industries is to educate themselves on legislation that is pertinent to their field of work. If you are starting a business that is fairly unregulated, try not to break any laws that already exist. Lastly, become proactive in the policymaking arena. You do not need a special license to speak with your local government officials, so advocate on behalf of your company if you truly believe that you are making positive change in the world.</p>
